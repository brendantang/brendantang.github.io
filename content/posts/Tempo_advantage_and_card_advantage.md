- Role: "Who is the beatdown?"
- But once you've identified your role, what to do with that? Aside from "I should be attacking" "I should be blocking"
- But it's obviously more complicated
- If you're the "beatdown", you care about how close you are to your win condition. Whether that is assembling a combo, getting to a critical mass board presence, or burning your op's life total to 0. That's __tempo advantage__.
- If you're the control, you care about how many times you can stop your opponent from reaching their win condition. 
  - A lot of the time this is talked about as "inevitablility"—if the game were to go on forever, who would win?
  - But that's a pretty fuzzy concept. What would it mean for the game to go on forever? There is no like neutral state where turns progress but players don't change the state of the game
  - What we are really talking about is __card advantage__.

## Important stumbling points
- Tempo advantage is not any one thing—board presence, mana advantage, life totals. 
  It is entirely dependent on your win condition.
- By the same token, card advantage can not be regarded as simply the number of cards in hand. 
  It's also card quality, selection, flexibility—how your answers line up with your opponent's challenges

## Deck archetypes are confusing

We name deck archetypes—"aggro, midrange, control"—after these concepts.
A control deck is _usually_ in the controlling role, an aggro deck is _usually_ in the beatdown role, and a midrange deck is _usually_ the beatdown against a control opponent and the control against an aggro opponent.
"Tempo" is an ambiguous archetype name that indicates a more fluid relationship to tempo and card advantage, but you can pretty much just think of it as midrange in the sense that it's usually prioritizing tempo advantage against a control opponent and card advantage against an aggro opponent.

Footnote?: Then there are more ambiguous archetype names like "combo" and "tempo." 
"Combo" is not really a useful category in this discussion.
There are decks that are focused on quickly assembling a win condition (like Neobrand or Reanimator)—for our purposes they are usually playing the beatdown role.
Though not attacking, they care about tempo: they want to assemble their win condition quickly and don't care about disrupting their opponent's win condition.

Footnote? What about "linear" vs. "interactive"? "Fair" vs "unfair"?
Often linear just means aggro.

## So what do we do with that information?

- Most writing on this topic just defines these concepts loosely and then says "pay attention to them."
  Are there any more concrete conclusions that we can draw?
- Know your role and recognize when it changes is of course step 1
- Given that I have correctly identified my role, how should I play?
  - Should I attack or block? Should I play into removal? How should I pace my board development?
- I think the missing piece of the puzzle is first recognizing your role (Aggro or control, do I prioritize tempo or card advantage?) but then going further and knowing whether you are ahead or behind on either axis.

- Whether to play into a wrath as the aggro deck is the perfect example of balancing these things.
  - Of course you're prioritizing a tempo advantage. If you get behind on tempo against control as the aggro deck, you have probably lost.
  - But you can still lose by getting too far behind on card advantage. If you dump your hand you may get very far ahead on tempo early—but you don't need to be _that_ far ahead to win, and then if your opponent's Wrath undoes most of your tempo advantage and you have no card advantage with which to build it back.
