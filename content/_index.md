Hi! I'm Brendan.  

This site is mostly just a nice place where I gather my thoughts and share them with a few friends.

I think a lot about information tech, design, and political economy.
Occasionally I may post notes or link lists on those topics here.

For money I work at a pickle factory and I independently practice web development and visual design.

If you'd like to say hi, you can send me an email at b@brendantang.net.
