Hi! I'm Brendan.  

I think a lot about information tech, design, and political economy.
Occasionally I post notes or link lists on those topics here, but mostly I just post very dry technical notes on web development.

For money I work at a pickle factory and I independently practice web development and visual design.

If you'd like to say hi, you can send me an email at b@brendantang.net.
