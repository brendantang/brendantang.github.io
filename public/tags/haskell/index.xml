IÂ meant to jot down some notes on my thought process while working on this problem and ended up writing like a whole walkthrough/comparison of the solution in both Ruby and Haskell lol
Here&amp;rsquo;s the repository with my answers.
So the problem is basically that we have a big text file full of records consisting of key:value pairs.</description></item><item><title>Advent of Code 2020 in Haskell</title><link>https://brendantang.net/2021/01/advent-of-code-2020-in-haskell/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 16:31:47 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://brendantang.net/2021/01/advent-of-code-2020-in-haskell/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with Haskell for a bit now and have decided use it to solve some of the puzzles in last year&amp;rsquo;s Advent of Code.
Usually I find it hard to motivate myself to try &amp;ldquo;coding exercises&amp;rdquo; like this. In general I have more momentum when I&amp;rsquo;m just trying to build something I want to use and learning things along the way. But Haskell is really different from anything I&amp;rsquo;m used to, so I have a lot of fundamentals to learn before I can build anything useful.</description></item></channel></rss>
